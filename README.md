You can select between two different characters, and you are supposed to progress through some levels.

It was build using [KineticJS](https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS?tab=readme-ov-file)https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS?tab=readme-ov-file, and it quite simple. There is no package manager, nor bundler. Pure HTML and JS files
